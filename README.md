- only the numbers 1 - 9 can be used 
- Every square must contain one number

# UX Design

## <p id="user_stories"> User Stories</p>
- As a user I want a digital version of sudoku to avoid paper waste.
- As a user I want varying levels of difficulty to suit the mood I am in or to train myself to get better at sudoku. 
-  As a user I want to know if my solution is correct or not.
- As a user I want to be able to pencil in numbers that can be edited later.


All user needs are met by the program. 

  - It is fully digital. 

  - It has 3 levels of difficulty to choose from. 

  - The user can choose to see the solution at the end of the game. 


  ## <p id="typography">Typography</p> 

  - [Arial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/arial) is used for the "RUN PROGRAM" button.
